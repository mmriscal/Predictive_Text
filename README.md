# Predictive_Text
APP to predict next word from previous.

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain.

In this app I train a model based on N-grams and Markov Chains to predict the next word given one or more previous words.
